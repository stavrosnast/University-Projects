# Hotel Room Reservation System

## Overview

This project aims to create a hotel room reservation system with a user-friendly web interface and multiple key features to help users book their desired rooms. The system provides the following functionalities:

1. **Home Page**: The Home page serves as the welcoming entrance to the hotel's online presence. It includes essential information about the hotel, such as its category, offered services, the number of rooms available, and more. Additionally, users can view photos of the hotel and the surrounding area, along with access to the hotel's address and contact details.

2. **Rooms Page**: The Rooms page is designed to assist users in selecting their ideal accommodations. It offers comprehensive descriptions and vivid images of various room types, including single, double, triple, and quadruple rooms. Users can browse these details to make informed choices.

3. **Reservation Page**: On the Reservation page, users can initiate the booking process for one or more rooms. They can specify their preferred dates, including check-in and check-out dates, and indicate the number of people for each room. To complete the reservation, users are required to fill out a contact information form.

4. **Contact Page**: The Contact page enables users to communicate with the hotel. Users can send messages, inquiries, or requests directly from this page, simplifying the process of getting in touch.

## Development Platform

This system is developed using the XAMPP platform, ensuring reliable and secure operation. XAMPP offers a versatile environment for developing and testing web applications and database-driven systems.

## Getting Started

To run this hotel room reservation system locally or deploy it on a web server, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have XAMPP or a similar server environment set up on your local machine or hosting server.

2. **Database Configuration**: Create a MySQL database with the name 'HOTEL_DB' to store reservation and contact form data.

3. **Code Deployment**: Deploy the project codebase, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files, to your web server or local directory.

4. **Start the Web Server**: If you're using XAMPP, start the Apache and MySQL services.

5. **Access the Website**: Open a web browser and navigate to your project's URL (e.g., `http://localhost/hotel-reservation-system`) to access the hotel room reservation system.
